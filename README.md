Permissioning on smart contract level.

Actual data encrypted by secret only know by blockchain.

Data structure:
    CreatedAt: timestamp
{
    EditedAt: timestamps
    Data: encryped paper
}

We cannot use channel for every paper because:
- it will not scale
- If the permissioned users change -> channel should change
- quering all that would not possible for example how many documents are in the system,
when that was created
